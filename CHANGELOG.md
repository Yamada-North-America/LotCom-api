# `v0.1.0`
### Label Generation
- Implement connection between `InterfaceCaptureValidator` and digital Label generation.
- Implement digital Label generation classes.

## `v0.1.1`
#### Print Spooling
- Implement connection between Label generation and printing.
- Implement Print Spooling classes.

# `v0.2.0`
### External Part Control
- Adopt [SemVer](https://semver.org/) (Semantic Versioning 2.0.0) versioning conventions.
- Implement integration with Database for external Process Part Number control.

## `v0.2.1`
#### Build Setup
- Build environment setup (manifests) for Windows MSIX Packaging.

# `v0.3.0`
### Operator ID Input
- Operator identification (initial) input in UI.
- Refactor `ProcessRequirements` datasource to leverage more code reuse and enforce universal basket data fields.
- Resolve issue with error messaging on UI validation failure ([#16](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/issues/16)).
- Resolve issue with improper JBK # formatting ([#17](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/issues/17)).

# `v0.4.0`
### JBK Queue System
- Global JBK # queueing and assignment system integration.
- General performance and clarity refactoring.
- Model Number UI control changed from a configured Picker to an implied Entry.

## `v0.4.1`
#### Label Serialization Build-out
- Implement `LotQueue`, a copy of `JBKQueue` to complete the Label serialization system.
- Implement actual consumption of serial numbers.

## `v0.4.2 (dead branch)`
#### Improve Serialization Integrity
- Adress a gap in the serialization system, outlined in [#25](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/issues/25).
- Approach 1; **not selected for implementation**.

## `v0.4.21`
#### Resolve Serial Number System timing gap
Approach 2:
- Consume the serial number at print execution:
  - Waits until the print job is started to read the queued serial number.
  - Places the serial number in the UI to be validated.
    - Consumes it if the job is successful; does not consume if not.
- Pros:
  - Eliminates* the problem and leaves no gaps in the FIFO ordering system.
    - There is a very, very small gap between queue read time and consumption time.
      - This could still duplicate serial numbers.
      - Future efficiency improvements should be made to limit the time between.
- Cons:
  - Operators cannot see the serial number while printing the Label.

## `0.4.22`
#### Build Environment Work

## `0.6.1.1`
#### Bugfix
- [bug/126](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/pull/127).
  - Resolve [#126](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/issues/126).

## `0.6.1.2`
#### Bugfixes
- [bug/128](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/pull/134).
  - Resolve [#128](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/issues/128).
  - Implements `GetPartInfo` computed property on `Part.cs`. 
    - Formats `Part.PartNumber` and `Part.PartName` into a singular string that the `PartPicker.ItemDisplayBinding` property can bind to.
- [bug/130](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/pull/132).
  - Resolve [#130](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/issues/130).
  - Implements `PassThroughHeadingType` property on `Process.cs`.
    - Matches a new key in the Process Datasource.
    - A `PassThroughHeadingType` value is assigned to Pass-through Processes and nullified on Originator Processes.
    - This property makes Header formatting possible on Pass-through Processes, which do not have a Serialization value.
  - Modifies `MainPageViewModel.FormatLabelHeader()` method to check both `Process.Serialization` and `Process.PassThroughHeadingType` for either `JBK` or `Lot` values before formatting the Label's header.
- [bug/131](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/pull/133).
  - Resolve [#131](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/issues/131).
  - Allows `SerialCacheController.RemoveCachedSerialNumber()` to ignore and immediately return null when an empty string passed as the `SerialNumber` parameter.
    - This was previously causing the method to throw an error because it was incapable of locating the empty string in the cache file.
    - Pass-through Processes do not prompt for a Serial Number in the UI, so they pass an empty string as the `SerialNumber` parameter when invoking the `RemoveCachedSerialNumber()` method.

  - Labels printed for the Deburr Process now print with JBK Number Headers.

#### Bugfix Patch
- [bug/179](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/pull/182).
  - The initial [fix](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/pull/180) for this issue opened a binding-related issue. This subsequent fault has been addressed, restoring intended functionality and truly addressing the Model Number Entry issue.

## `0.7.0.4`
#### Minor feature update
This update implements the following minor functional features:
- Integration with **LotCom Libraries**, **LotCom's** dedicated library of models;
- Large-scale UI redesign to meet user friendliness requests;
- Integration with new Database Schema `v3`;
- Implementation of Confirmation Popups for impactful user actions;
- CI/CD automation refactor to produce `MSI` installers over `MSIX` packages.

#### PRs

- [`feature/184`](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/pull/185):
  - Project Model updated to utilize the **LotCom Libraries** class library. 
  - Pulling classes such as **Type** and **Datasources** from the class library helps improve project maintainability by removing the need to maintain copies on each **LotCom** component.
- [`feature/187`](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/pull/193):
  - References to modified Process properties updated to restore intended functionality.
  - The modifications and additions made to the Database Schema (documented in [LotCom Libraries #6](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCom-libraries/pull/7)) created faulting references throughout the **LotCom** environment. These references impacted the functionality and usability of the application.
- [`feature/191`](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/pull/194):
  - Implemented Confirmation popups following impactful buttons and actions.
  - To protect the application and the user from unintentionally making impactful changes, confirmation popups were added. Now, there are two levels of action between the user and an impactful choice.
- [`feature/188`](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/pull/195):
  - Implemented new CI/CD automation pipeline to better interface with YNA IT and to improve deployment cleanliness.
  - YNA IT's automation processes generally center on the use of MSI installers. The key difference between MSI and MSIX installers is that MSI installs as the system, while MSIX only installs as the user. This causes issues for their automation and creates incongruous installations. There have been multiple cases of faulting application instances on different computers due to deployment issues. With the MSI installation process, YNA IT can force installation at the system level, ensuring clean and uniform application instances.
- [`feature/186`](https://github.com/LotCoM/LotCoM-printer/pull/192):
  - User Interface components redesigned to meet user requests and improve user-friendliness.
  - The original UI was very sterile and low contrast. This interface style is not good for users who aren't familiar with computer systems/don't use a lot of software. Higher contrast and more intense interfaces generally work better for users who are less adept with computer applications.
